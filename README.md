# Applied Data Science Capstone - Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the Applied Data Science Capstone project, focusing on predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX, renowned for its reusable rocket technology, advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a significantly lower cost compared to other providers. The primary reason for this cost reduction is the ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. Therefore, accurate prediction of whether the first stage will successfully land is crucial for estimating the cost of a launch. Such information is valuable for companies considering bidding against SpaceX for a rocket launch contract.

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, we leverage data science techniques to predict the landing outcome of the Falcon 9 first stage. The project involves various stages, including data collection, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following components:

### Labs

The project labs are arranged sequentially and can be found in the repository as Lab 1 through Lab n. These labs cover various aspects of the project, such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Presentation

At the conclusion of the project, a PowerPoint presentation is available as a PDF file. This presentation provides insights into the data analysis, modeling approach, and findings of the Falcon 9 first stage landing prediction project.

## How to Use

To explore the project materials, navigate to the respective directories for labs and the presentation PDF. Each lab contains detailed instructions and code for that specific stage of the project.

## Dependencies

The project relies on common data science libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Plotly. Ensure that these dependencies are installed to run the code successfully.
